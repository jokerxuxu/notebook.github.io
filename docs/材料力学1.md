# 1.Introduction
## 1.1 Objects and Tasks

Deformable Bobdies
4 Basic Deformations:

- Tension and Compression (columns)
- Bending
- Shear (beams)
- Torsion (shafts)

Tasks:

- Strength: Ability to resist fracture or materials do not collapse under large plastic deformation.
- Rigidity: Ability to resist deformation (Elastic).
- Stability: Ability to keep equilibrium configuration.

## 1.2 Fundemental Assumptions

4 Fundemental Asuumptions:

- Continuty
- Homogeneity
- Isotropy
- Small deformation

## 1.3 External Force

Acting modes:

- Surface force(distribution force & Concentration force)
- Body force(self-weight & inertia force)
Loading-Time:
- Static load
- Dynamic load(Alternationg load & impact load)
